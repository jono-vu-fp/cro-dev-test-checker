After sunset, darkness causes the body to produce melatonin, signalling to the body that it is time to sleep. This is the regular circadian rhythm, the body's natural wake and sleep cycle. Exposure to blue light for children, tweens & teens, at night disrupts this process, reducing melatonin release and telling the brain that it is still daytime. Reduced melatonin makes it harder to fall asleep and contributes to poor sleep quality. Proper sleep patterns are essential for youngsters and can cause antisocial behavious, depression and a number of other issues. In addition, excessive exposure to artificial blue light can also lead to digital eye strain, irritation and headaches. Children are more vulnerable than adults because their eyes absorb more blue light from digital devices.<\/p>","bgblock":"#c2469f","textblock":"#ffffff"}},"0c2c762a-1318-4131-9ab0-9f4913c6febd":{"type":"faq","settings":{"title":"Where is the artificial blue light coming from?","content":"<p>Artificial blue light is found in electronic devices and appliances that emits light which containing shades of blue, even if is not immediately apparent to the naked eye.
